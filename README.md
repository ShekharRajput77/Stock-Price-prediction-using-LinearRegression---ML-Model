This is a simple ML model which predicts the stock Prices using ML LinearRegression Algorithm. 
It shows the Plot of Actual Price vs Predicted Price and Scatte Plot for the same.

I have tested it with Nvidia amd AMD stock Reports.
R - Rooted Score is 87% which is a good fit but not perfect. 

I will be working upon the rest 13% of Variance and will keep posted. 

Thanks!!
